# # Train Bogie Matching and Journey Processing



## Description

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation for processing train journeys and matching train bogies based on specific station data. The provided code takes input data for two trains, performs the matching of bogies with station data, calculates distances, and generates arrival and departure messages for the train journeys.

## Key Features

- Parses input data to extract train information and bogie details.
- Matches train bogies with station data and applies conditions for matching.
- Calculates distances between stations for sorting and filtering.
- Generates arrival messages for Train A and Train B based on matched bogies.
- Produces a departure message with the final list of bogies for the journey.
